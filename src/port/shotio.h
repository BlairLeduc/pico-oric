 * the guest, F6 parks it for the shot alone; in the menu or pause it is
 * parked already. The image is what the panel shows, regenerated row by
 * row from what was last sent to it (display_panel_row), so a menu page
 * is taken as readily as the guest's screen. The file is written as
 * SHOTnnnn.new and renamed once whole, as the other writers do.
 *
 * Copied from pico-ace and renamed.
