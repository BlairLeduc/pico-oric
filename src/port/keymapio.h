 * the menu opens, with the card mounted (storage.h) and core 0 parked or
 * not yet started. A rescan rewrites the card's layouts in place, which
 * is safe because core 0 takes the layout again after every park, and a
 * key already down holds a copy of its binding (keymatrix.h). A file
 * that does not parse is left out, and the first such file and line is
 * kept for the menu's status row.
