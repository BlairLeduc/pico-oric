/* southbridge.h — the PicoCalc's keyboard/power MCU on i2c1 (hardware-notes.md §6).
 *
 * An STM32 at 0x1F, 10 kHz. Keyboard, both backlights, battery and power
 * all live behind it; nothing is wired to the processor directly. Each
 * transaction costs 4-5 ms of wall time (§6.1), which makes this the most
 * expensive routine operation on the machine — so it is polled from the
 * frame loop in thread context, never from a timer IRQ.
 *
 * This is the register layer only. Key-event normalisation belongs to
 * kbd.c, on top of it.
