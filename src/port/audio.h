/* audio.h — PWM slice, chained DMA, and the PCM queue (design.md §8.4; EL §6.2).
 *
 * Core 0 owns all of it: the field loop pushes the guest's samples in
 * thread context and DMA_IRQ_0, also on core 0, drains them into the
 * ring. The queue is single-producer single-consumer between those two.
 *
 * Pushing blocks while the queue is full, and that is the emulator's
 * throttle (EL §6.3): the PWM wrap is a hardware clock derived from
 * clk_sys, and pacing on it holds the queue at depth without a
 * wall-clock timer.
