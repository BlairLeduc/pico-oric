/* park.h — the guest parked at a field boundary, the machine core 1's
 * (design.md §4.5; EL §2.5).
 *
 * Card work, the menu, pause and restart all go through here. Core 0
 * stops between two fields, names the reason in g_park, and from then
 * on the machine is core 1's until core 1 writes PARK_NONE back. Core 0
 * keeps the audio queue fed with silence meanwhile, at the rate it
 * drains, so audio neither underruns nor loses its pacing, and guest
 * time does not pass.
 *
 * Five reasons: the UART's hold, which runs the card job; a tape request
 * (tapeio.h); the menu; pause (menu.h); and a screenshot (shotio.h). The menu and pause own the
 * keyboard while they last, so core 0 leaves the key ring to core 1 for
 * them; a hold's keys are not the guest's either, and core 0 drops them;
 * a screenshot's wait for the guest.
 *
 * Copied from pico-ace and renamed.
