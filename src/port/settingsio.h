/* settingsio.h — the settings file on the card, /oric/pico-oric.cfg
 * (design.md §10.7; EL §8.7).
 *
 * Core 1, with the card mounted (storage.h) and core 0 waiting or
 * parked. There is no file on a new card, and that is not a problem:
 * everything keeps its default (settings.h).
 *
 * The first problem is kept for the heartbeat and the menu's status row
 * (design.md §12): a line the parser refused, a file that could not be
 * read, or a value the port could not act on.
 *
 * Copied from pico-ace and renamed.
 *
 * The menu's save writes the file through a temporary file and a rename
 * (EL §8.6); a load that finds only the temporary file, a save cut off
 * between the two, takes it.
