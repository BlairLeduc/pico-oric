/* via6522.h — the 6522 VIA at #0300 (design.md §2.2, §2.3, §6.4).
 *
 * pico-atom's part, copied whole (its design.md §7.4): both ports with input latching, the
 * four control lines in every PCR mode (edge interrupts, handshake and
 * pulse outputs, manual levels), T1 one-shot and free-run with its PB7
 * output, T2 one-shot and counting pulses on PB6, and the shift
 * register in all eight modes. T1 reloads after latch + 2 cycles in
 * free-run mode, the part's period.
 *
 * The chip knows nothing of the Oric. The machine wires it (§2.3): PA
 * and CA2/CB2 to the AY's bus, PB0-PB3 to the keyboard, CB1 and PB7 to
 * the tape, PB6 to the motor relay. The outside world is a set of calls: via6522_set_ca1() and its kind put a
 * level on a pin, and the outputs are fields to read (`pa_out()`,
 * `pb_out()`, `ca2`, `cb1`, `cb2`). Timing is to the instruction: the
 * machine ticks the chip once per instruction with its cycle count.
 *
 * The tick costs the same whatever the chip is doing (§3.2): it
 * counts T1 and one countdown to the next thing T2 or the shift
 * register will do, and does the rest out of line when either runs
 * out. So `t2` and `sr_timer` lag between those events; the register
 * reads that show them bring them up to date, and anything else that
 * looks at them calls via6522_sync() first.
