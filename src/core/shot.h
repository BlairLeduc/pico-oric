/* shot.h — a screenshot as a BMP file (design.md §12).
 *
 * The panel has no framebuffer (§7.1), so a screenshot is generated row
 * by row, as a present is, and each row encoded here as it comes. BMP,
 * 24 bits a pixel and uncompressed, because every viewer opens it and it
 * needs neither a buffer of the whole image nor a compressor. Its rows
 * are stored bottom-up: the caller asks the panel for row h-1 first.
 *
 * Portable C, so the host tests encode with the firmware's code. No
 * allocation: the caller owns every buffer.
 *
 * Copied from pico-ace and renamed.
