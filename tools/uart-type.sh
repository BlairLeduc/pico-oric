#
# The firmware turns each received byte into the PicoCalc key events for
# it (keymap_picocalc_text, called from uart_keys in src/port/core0.c), so a
# hardware run can be driven from the machine capturing it. Characters type
# as themselves, the shifted ones inside Shift as the PicoCalc sends them;
# CR and LF are Enter, BS and DEL Backspace, ESC is Esc, the other
# control characters are Ctrl chords, and \x81-\x85 are F1-F5, \x86-\x89
# and \x90 F6-F10. M6 logs each event with the cell the map gives it; from
# M7 they go through keymatrix to the guest, as the keyboard's do.
#
# One character every 0.25 s: the replay takes 6 fields a key, 0.12 s
# (config.h, ORIC_KEY_MIN_FIELDS + ORIC_KEY_GAP_FIELDS), and a faster sender
# fills the UART's 32-byte FIFO and loses characters. UART_TYPE_DELAY
# overrides it.
#
# Writing while uart-log.sh reads is fine: that script refuses a second
# *reader*; this only writes. The port's settings are the ones uart-log.sh
# applied, so start the capture first.
