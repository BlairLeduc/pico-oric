# Reset with both cores held, then release them together. OpenOCD's reset
# asserts SYSRESETREQ once per core, and on RP2350 that resets only the core
# that asks. A plain "reset run" restarts core 0 first; it boots and launches
# core 1 within milliseconds, and then OpenOCD resets core 1 back into the
# bootrom, where it waits for a launch that has already happened. The
# symptom is a firmware whose core 1 prints its first line and goes silent.
# A power-on reset does not do this; only the debugger's does.
